## 📝 Project Overview
This repository contains a clustering analysis of stunting among toddlers in Indonesia. The goal is to uncover patterns and groupings in the stunting data to provide insights that may assist in targeting interventions and policies.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Perform clustering analysis on stunting data in toddlers across various regions of Indonesia.
- Identify groups of toddlers based on various factors related to stunting such as age, nutrition, health status, etc.
- Provide insights to stakeholders for addressing stunting challenges effectively.

*Note: The dataset is anonymized to protect individual privacy.*

## ⚙️ Clustering Methods
Several clustering algorithms are implemented in this analysis to explore different groupings:
1. **K-Means Clustering**
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**

Each of these algorithms is evaluated based on clustering quality and interpretability of results.
